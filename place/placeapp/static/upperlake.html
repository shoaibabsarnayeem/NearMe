    <h2>UPPER LAKE</h2>
    <h3>LOCATED IN KODAIKANAL</h3>
    <p>
        Kodaikanal's Upper Lake View is a famous, free viewpoint offering stunning panoramic vistas of the star-shaped Kodai Lake, its lush surroundings, and the distant hills, ideal for photography, especially early morning, providing a tranquil escape with food stalls and crafts nearby, despite its name referring to a viewpoint overlooking the main lake, not a separate lake. 
Key Aspects:
The View: A bird's-eye perspective of the iconic star-shaped Kodaikanal Lake and dense greenery.
Best Time: Early mornings (before 8 AM) for calm, clear views and fewer crowds; daytime for bright photos.
Attractions: Photography, nature appreciation, serene atmosphere.
Amenities: Food stalls, local crafts, seating, easily accessible by transport.
Cost/Entry: Free entry, open during daytime hours (e.g., 10 AM - 5 PM, though viewpoints are often accessible longer).
Location: A short distance from Coakers Walk, often visited en route to Green Valley Viewpoint. 
In essence, it's a prime spot to capture the essence of Kodaikanal's beauty from above.
